📈 SODA — Investment Platform

SODA is a full-stack investment platform built to explore modern web architecture, clean project structure, and scalable development workflows.
This project includes a fully separated backend and frontend, all orchestrated with Docker for easy deployment.

🚀 Main Features

Full-Stack Architecture
Clean separation between backend and frontend for maintainability and scalability.

Backend (Node.js / JavaScript)
Structured REST API designed to handle authentication, investment logic, and data operations.

Frontend (JavaScript)
Web interface focused on usability and clarity, prepared for expansion with dashboards, charts, and user tools.

Docker & Docker Compose
The entire development environment can be launched with a single command — no manual configuration required.

Portfolio-Ready Project
Clear folder structure, modern tooling, and easily extendable modules make SODA ideal as a showcase of full-stack development.
